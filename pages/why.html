        WHY

        According to WHO, road accidents kill 1.35 million people and injure 50 million every year globally, and it’s the leading cause of death in children and adults aged 5 to 29 years.[1-3] And also in Canada, every year 2,000-3,000 people are killed in road accidents, 165,000 get injured, and it costs society $37 billion.[4-6] But, these accidents are preventable because around 95% of the road accidents are caused by human errors.[4,7] 

        One of the biggest reasons for road accidents is drunk driving, but drowsy driving—the second biggest reason—is as dangerous as drunk driving. Missing just two to three hours of sleep can increase your risk for a crash by more than 4-times, which is the equivalent of driving drunk.[17] Less sleep leads to mental impairment that is similar to drunkenness—with 18 hours without sleep is similar to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05% and 24 hours to a BAC of 0.10% (which is extremely high).[8,9]

        Drowsy driving accounts for 20% to 40% of the road accidents.[6,10,11,20] In a survey, 60% of drivers admitted that they have driven while drowsy [6,11], and a staggering 20%-37% of people have actually fallen asleep at the wheel in the past year.[6,11,20] The dangers of drowsy driving is underestimated because it’s often impossible to determine whether drowsy driving actually caused an accident, especially after fatal accidents.[8] Falling asleep at the wheel is clearly dangerous, but drowsy driving is also dangerous because:[14]
        It decreases your ability to pay attention to the road.
        It slows your reaction time if you must brake or steer suddenly.
        It badly affects your ability to make good decisions.
        Drowsy driving is dangerous for everyone, but certain people are at higher risk because of the following reasons:[8,12,14]
        Sleep deprived: such as long-haul truckers, bus drivers. Also teenagers, who have less driving experience and are mostly sleep deprived. Less sleep causes microsleeps. Microsleep is when a person dozes off for just a few seconds.[8] 
        Sleep disorders: such as sleep apnea (6-times more likely to have accidents), insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement in sleep, parkinson's disease, dementia, epilepsy
        Some medications: benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistaminics, antipsychotics and others
        Drinking alcohol
        Irregular shift-work [13]
        Sopite Syndrome: It’s a variant of motion sickness, where you don’t feel sick, but you get sleepy when moving. The vibrations at low frequencies make us feel drowsy. After driving for only 15 minutes, the levels of alertness begin to decrease dramatically, and by 30 minutes, it has a significant impact, and by 60 minutes, sleepiness is at its peak.[15]
        Drowsiness-related fatal accidents occur mostly in the middle of the night—3 am to 6 am, and afternoon—3 pm to 6 pm, when sleepiness peaks.[6,8] Everybody has busy schedules and can’t find enough time to get proper rest. 51% of adults worldwide report that they get less sleep than they need on an average night.[19] Drowsy driving is a major issue, so I wanted to find a solution to this problem which affects more than half of the world’s adult population who drive, and for that I made ADD+ app to help prevent drowsy drivers from falling asleep at the wheel, and thus save lives.
